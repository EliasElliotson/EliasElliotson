# Hi there!

My name's Eli, and I'm a 15 year old developer from Canada!

I'm currently working on building a 2D game engine so that I can eventually get around to making some sellable indie games.  I'm also working on a AI face tracker so I can make a cool cartoon filter for my webcam and replace the memoji here on my GitHub profile with something a little bit more original :)

I'm currently learning tons of things, such as physics, networking, the rendering pipeline, data compression, web design, maturity, and more.  I'm hoping to get better at matrices and vectors.

Fun fact: Did you know that clouds typically weigh a million tons?  Or did you know that a chicken once survived 18 months without a head?
