# Hi there!

My name's Eli, and I'm a 15 year old developer from Canada!

I'm currently working on building a 2D game engine so that I can eventually get around to making some sellable indie games, as well as developing several applications for my church.

I'm also learning tons of new things, such as physics, networking, the rendering pipeline, data compression, web design, socializing, and much more.  I'm hoping to get better at binary operations, vectors and linear algebra, fragment shaders, and calculus.

I used to work for a small incorporation called _Cracklecat Inc_. where I got to work on several sites owned by _Advice On Wealth_, as well as the _Moo To Do_ app by _CATTLEytics_.

Fun fact: Did you know that clouds typically weigh a million tons?  Or did you know that a chicken once survived 18 months without a head?
